As the files to be generated are "startup_sequence.py" and "README.md", they don't share any direct dependencies as one is a Python script and the other is a markdown file. However, there are some indirect dependencies or related elements:

1. Project Information: Both files will need to reference the project's name, version, and other metadata.

2. Function Names: If the Python script contains functions that are important for the user to understand, these should be documented in the README file.

3. Error Messages: If the Python script has specific error messages, these could be documented in the README file for troubleshooting purposes.

4. Execution Instructions: The README file should contain instructions on how to execute the Python script, so the command to run the script is a shared element.

5. Dependencies: If the Python script requires any external libraries or modules, these should be listed in the README file.

Please note that as these are not JavaScript files, there are no shared exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, or message names.
